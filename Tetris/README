Aspect Tetris 

Program originally written for a course project by Gustav Evertsson
and found on the site:

  http://www.guzzzt.com/coding/aspecttetris.shtml

There's an accompanying report in this file.

This version modified by Clark Verbrugge, March 2004 to act as a benchmark
without human interaction, and more specifically to do the following:

1) Compile properly with a new version of AspectJ.

2) Emit data to stdout about important events, suitable for recording
for later replay.

3) Parse new command line arguments, and branch to new behaviour
replaying a recorded file.

To play back:
java Main.AspectTetris -f someFile

To record:
java Main.AspectTetris > someFile

For other options run:
java.Main.AspectTetris -h

Note about replay.  This is not guaranteed to be identical.
Specifically, creating data to record perturbs the application (time
stamps and i/o), event playback may not begin at exactly the same
point, event processing duration is not well accounted for in
playback, a Timer thread is bypassed in playback, among the usual
Java & MT indeterminacies.
